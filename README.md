#  Feather Light – A Manifesto for Hidden Precision 🕊️
*Written by Ian Patel, Creator & Architect of Feather Light*

## Introduction  
In a world addicted to dashboards and dopamine, Feather Light dares to disappear.
Not to show you more. But to reveal what's already there.

**Feather Light** was not designed to be seen.  
It was designed to be **felt**.

Where most software screams for attention, Feather Light observes — passively, precisely, and without ego.  
It does not measure you for the world. It measures you **for yourself**.  
It does not send your data to “the cloud.” It encrypts it **under your key**.  
It does not predict behavior. It **reveals** behavior.

> This is not just another productivity tool.  
> This is your **invisible cognitive layer**.

##  Purpose: What *is* Feather Light? 🎯

At its core, **Feather Light** is a:

**Privacy-first activity logging & local AI summarization framework for Windows.**

But it is far more than that.

Feather Light is a:

- 🪞 **Behavioral mirror** for those who strive to optimize how they work  
- 📓 **Local journaling framework**, powered by your own machine — not a Silicon Valley server  
- ⚙️ **Cognitive runtime**, silently running in the background, preserving context you’ll thank yourself for tomorrow

##  Why It Exists 💡

In every system — whether a company, startup, or creative mind — patterns of inefficiency creep in **unnoticed**.  
**Feather Light exists to counteract that entropy.**

It was built from two simple truths:

1. **You cannot master what you cannot measure**  
2. **You should never have to trade privacy for insight**

So I built this for:

- The **founder** buried in their startup, forgetting where their hours went  
- The **engineer** who wants to reflect deeply on their flow  
- The **professional** who wishes to journal, but never finds time  
- The **enterprise** that values trust, sovereignty, and compliance  

Feather Light **reveals.** It **summarizes.** It **evolves** with you.  
**Privately.**

✅ Summarizes logs using **local LLMs** like **OpenHermes via Ollama**  
✅ Provides a CLI interface for:

- One-time logging  
- Background loop logging  
- Log encryption/decryption  
- Summary generation

##  Who Is It For? 👤

Feather Light isn’t for everyone.

It’s for those who:

- Value their time like **capital**  
- Want to own 100% of their **behavioral data**  
- Prefer **silence over distraction**  
- Reflect **deeply**  
- Move **powerfully**  
- Build **quietly**

Feather Light is **not for the masses**.  
It’s for the **mental elites** who see software as scaffolding for empires.

##  Positioning: This is Not a Tool — It’s Infrastructure 🧱

Feather Light is a **hidden framework**.  
Just like Redis or Nginx powers billions of systems you’ll never see, Feather Light aims to be:

- 🫥 **Ubiquitous among those who know**  
- 🪶 **Minimal in presence**  
- 🧠 **Foundational in value**

> One day, your OS might come with something like this built-in.  
> Until then — you have **Feather Light**.

##  Installation (Simple Guide) 🪶

🖥️ **Currently supported:** Windows 10 and above  
🔒 **macOS/Linux support coming soon**

---

###  Step-by-Step ✅

1. **Download the repository as a ZIP**  
2. **Extract the folder and open it in a terminal**  
3. Run:

```bash
python installation.py
```
Now this will prompt to install Ollama if not already installed. Feather Light v1 uses **OpenHermes via Ollama** for maximum privacy as we believe that **Your** Data must stay on **Your Device**

4. Now make sure you activate your venv by running:
CMD:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
PowerShell:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
Now you are ready to use Feather Light v1!
5. Run:
```bash
featherlight --help
```

## Journaling Reimagined ✍️
At any time, just run:
```bash
featherlight --summarize
```
You’ll receive a diary-style, beautifully structured summary of your day, generated locally using OpenHermes.
Perfect for:
-  Deep reflection
-  Syncing with your journal
-  Weekly reviews
-  Behavioral insight
> This may cause temporary lag, as your machine runs a private AI model — but it’s worth it. This is your mind, summarized.
